<h1>Assignment 1: Basic HTML Display Features</h1></center>

<p>A basic page needs only a bare minimum of programming. Graphics are an important part of Web pages but so too are words. I look upon the Web as a medium for ideas and the use of new technologies, but not the other way around. A Web page tells a great story with great graphical and analytical presentation.</p>

<p>Using the "view" option look at the source code for this document. The background color and the text declared in the body refer to a coding system that combines a system of numbers and letters to create thousands of possible color choices. The body color indicates white and the text as being black. I could have just written in "white" and "black" instead of these codes.</p>

<p>Here is an example of a horizontal rule:</p>
<hr>

<p>To begin, we can change the</p>
<h2>header size</h2>

<p>and <a href="#">color of letters</a> seen on the screen. The <strong>font size</strong> can be changed as well, and actually gives us more choices.</p>

<p>We can also change the appearance of words on the screen. This shows some differing word types in a blocked quote.</p>

<blockquote>
    Now is the time for all good <strong>people</strong> to come to the aid of their country.
</blockquote>

<p>That was also an example of a nested command.</p>
